# gnome-shell-theme-darclassic
A very simple darker modification of the standard theme for Gnome 3.16.

To change the color palette, 
simply play with colors in `gnome-shell/gnome-shell-sass/_color.scss` 
and generate css by running

    sass --sourcemap=none --update .

in the `gnome-shell` folder.
