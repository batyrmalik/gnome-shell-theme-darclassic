# gnome-shell-theme-darclassic
A very simple darker modification of the standard theme for Gnome 3.16.

To change the color palette, 
simply play with colors in `gnome-shell/gnome-shell-sass/_color.scss` 
and generate css by running

    sass --sourcemap=none --update .

in the `gnome-shell` folder.

When having *User Themes* extension installed, you can do this directly in your `~/.themes` folder and run `rt` via `Ctrl-F2` to reload the theme immediately.
